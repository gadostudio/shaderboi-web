### a) Customers and subcontractors (contracting parties)

Complete obligations under agreement and law.

In connection with the provision of our services, We may process the personal data of customers and potential customers (see categories of personal data under section 4 above) in order to fulfil our obligations under the agreement with the customer, administer bookings, manage orders and make mandatory controls that follow from applicable law. We may hire subcontractors in order to be able to provide our services. In such case, We may process personal data relating to the employees of the subcontractors (see categories of personal data under section 4 above) in order to be able to fulfil our commitments under the agreement with the subcontractor, administering bookings, manage orders and make mandatory controls that follow from applicable law. The legal basis for this processing is that it is necessary in order to fulfil Shaderboi' obligations pursuant to an agreement and/or applicable law. Personal data needed to fulfil contractual obligations towards our contracting parties (customers/subcontractors) will be deleted twelve (12) months after We have fulfilled all of our obligations under the applicable agreement and met the counterparty's interests pursuant to applicable laws and agreements (such as warranty rights and warranty obligations). In some cases, Shaderboi may have a legal obligation to process personal data related to our contractors. This applies, for example, to the processing of personal data that We carry out in order to meet the requirements of the Indonesian Accounting Act, prevent fraud and carry out risk management. Personal data processed to fulfil our legal obligations will be erased within seven (7) years after We have fulfilled all of our obligations under the applicable
agreement.

Balancing of interests
Part of the processing of personal data carried out by Shaderboi is based on legitimate interests. This, for example, applies to the processing of data regarding potential contracting parties (customers/subcontractors) where the purpose is to develop new business opportunities and organize future collaborations where processing is necessary to satisfy Shaderboi' legitimate business interests. Furthermore, We can, with the support of balancing interests as a legal basis, treat subcontractor's employees' personal data in order to ensure that resources are linked together with the appropriate assignment or project. Personal data processed employing legitimate interests as legal basis, will be deleted within twelve (12) months after We have fulfilled all of our obligations under the applicable agreement.

### b) Job applicants

Shaderboi processes personal data relating to job applicants in order to be able to evaluate and register candidates, book interviews and manage contact with the job applicants. The legal basis for processing is that it is necessary in order to enter into a potential agreement with the job applicant. The applicant's personal data that is processed by Shaderboi will be deleted within one (1) month after the end of the recruitment process.

## 7. Who can We share personal data with?

Shaderboi has entered into data processing agreements with these third parties.
